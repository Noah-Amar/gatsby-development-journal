Today was the most mentally tiring day of the week. I spent three quarters of my day troubleshooting git issues before actually being able to write any code. Positive takeaways were an amazing UI/UX meeting with legendary instructor Josh Knell giving us the lowdown on how to create a great user experience, as well as gaining new domain names for our site (we are now https://www.vbeloved.com/) to replace the random generated ones initially given to us. 

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
