This is my first post documenting my Lambda Labs experience building my new capstone project ..! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote on self-motivation that serves as food for thought as I push through the final 5 weeks of [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/).

> “People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with
> mediocrity no matter how impressive their other talents.” 
> Andrew Carnegie
